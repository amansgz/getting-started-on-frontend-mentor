## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**Semantic HTML**

- Used an `<article>` as our main card component

**Styling and Layout Approach**

- Implemented a design system based on the `Figma design` and style guide, using `CSS custom properties` for colors, font styles and elements spacing
- `Mobile-first` workflow

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to solidify my HTML & CSS foundations by:

- Diving deeper into semantic HTML and accessibility attributes.
- Exploring advanced uses of CSS custom properties for theming and responsive design
